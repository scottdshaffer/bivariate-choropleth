# Showing correlation and geography at the same time.
## This is how you make a pretty and informative bivariate choropleth map with [`tidycensus`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidycensus/index.html) and [`biscale`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biscale/index.html). 

Scatterplots show the relationship between two variables. Choropleth maps show the relative concentration of a variable across geographies. If you want to show the relationship between two variables across geographies, things get a little bit tricky. This is where bivariate choropleth maps come in! 

My map shows how racial composition and educational attainment vary across census tracts in Hennepin County, Minnesota. I noticed a few things after making the map:
* The concentration of non-white people without college degrees in north Minneapolis, northwestern suburbs, and southern suburbs
* The concentration of white people with college degrees along the chain of lakes and Minnehaha Creek
* The absence of red tracts (mostly white without college degrees) in Minneapolis proper

One cosmetic problem I ran into: the `biscale` legend uses unicode arrows like this: â†’. If you want to use a different typeface &mdash; and don't want to dig through the code for the `bi_legend()` function and replace the arrows &mdash; you'll need to pick a font that supports unicode, like [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans). Roboto and Lato won't cut it.
